## Current Tasks for Tuesday, December 5th, 19:30
- Prepare presentation for coming Wednesday (ALL)
- Investigate three serial connection/UART methods:
    1. Using Arduino, logic converter, serial Arduino's serial monitor (Renad)

- Implement encryption scheme in Verilog (Jilin)

- Additional Resources
    - UART:

    - XILINX A7 Board: https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-a7/reference-manual

## More Notes
- what is the 'host computer'? just our laptop
- fpga board
- program uart controller in verilog
- use serial interface already programmed
- use arduino serial monitor and figure out how communication works with that
- send data from fpga to computer (serial monitor)
- wire tx to rx on fpga board
