## Updates
- We are functional!!! Everything is working as expected, albeit the long debugging session...
- We are also adding a Python-to-UART script, so users can easily input via the script.
- Also working on trying to automate button presses - previously we needed to hit two buttons, one for loading the FPGA with the input data, and another for outputting. We want to automate the entire thing so that it would just automatically output after the user has inputted data.

## Next Steps
- Automate button presses (one remanining)
- Fix Python script
- Clean up code and documentation
- Code Overview section of repo readme
- Project Demo video
