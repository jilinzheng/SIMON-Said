## Current Tasks:
- Meet 30-45 minutes before class to go over presentation
- Present in class tomorrow
- Meet briefly after class to discuss next steps in terms of implementation and division of labor

## 231205 Notes
- finalized presentation details
- much closer to final design choices
  - currently have two methods of sending data to FPGA: UART (via serial terminals) or Arduino (needs logic converter)
