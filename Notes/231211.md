## Updates
- Another day of great progress!
- We achieved:
  - No hard-coded key! The user can input their own key, along with the data, prompted by the Python script!
  - >1 block processing, i.e. we can support more bits of user input (currently from 64 bits to 128 bits)!
  - Full automation of project outside of toggling between encryption and decryption mode!
    - All the user has to do now is set the mode, and enter their key and message, all under the direction of the Python script!

## Next Steps
- Finalize design choices, particularly how many blocks to have, which determines how big the user input can be.
- Record demo video.
- Go over project contribution.
- Finalize, at least begin to, project submission.
