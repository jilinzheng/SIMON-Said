## Updates
- The block cipher, SIMON 64/96 is complete!
  - Originally wanted to have the entire family of SIMON ciphers (via parameterization), but with the time constraint of this project, one configuration was selected instead.
- Sending data via UART is still a WIP...

## Member Tasks:
- Renad and Jilin:
  - Completed: SIMON64/96 with Key-Scheduling, Encryption, and Decryption, with preliminary verification for all components.
  - Working on: Cleaning up documentation, creating additional test cases.
- Rayan and Jackson:
  - Complete: Basic data transmission and reception with UART (between host PC using terminal emulators, e.g. PuTTy and Tera Term, and FPGA).
  - Working on: Formatting data transmission to cipher requirements.
